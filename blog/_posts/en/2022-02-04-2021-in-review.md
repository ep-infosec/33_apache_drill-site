What's this, a short post written only to tantalise us with news of the looming Drill 1.20?  That announcement is indeed soon to follow, but this post is no mere teaser.  Here we share with the community a copy of Cong Luo's excellent review of the Drill project in 2021.  If you missed out on this presentation in the January 2022 meetup then [here, at least, is a digital copy of the content]({{site.baseurl}}/static/cong-luo-2021-review.pdf).

The next community meetup is later today, and the details for joining are [on the Community Resources page]({{site.baseurl}}/community-resources/).  Come and join us!
