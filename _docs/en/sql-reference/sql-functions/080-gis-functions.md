**Introduced in release:** 1.14.

Drill contains a suite of Geographic Information System (GIS) functions. Most of the functionality follows that of PostGIS.  To use these functions, your spatial data must be defined in the Well-Known Text (WKT) representation format.  The WKT format allows you to represent points, lines, polygons, and other geometric shapes. Following are two example WKT strings:

```
POINT (30 10)
POLYGON ((30 10, 40 40, 20 40, 10 20, 30 10))
```

Drill stores points as binary, so to read or plot these points you need to convert them using the `ST_AsText()` and `ST_GeoFromText()` functions.  The following table list the GIS functions included in Drill.
