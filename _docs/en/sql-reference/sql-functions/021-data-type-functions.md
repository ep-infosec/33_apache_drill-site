**Introduced in release:** 1.14

Drill supports the following functions that return data type information:

**sqlTypeOf()**
Returns the data type of a column (using the SQL names) whether the column is NULL or not. You can use the SQL name in a CAST statement, for example:

              sqlTypeOf( CAST(x AS <data type> ))
              //Returns <data type> as the type name.
If the type is DECIMAL, the type also includes precision and scale, for example:

              DECIMAL(6, 3)
**modeOf()**
Returns the cardinality (mode) of the column as "NOT NULL", "NULLABLE", or "ARRAY". Drill data types include a cardinality, for example `Optional Int` or `Required VarChar`.

**drillTypeOf()**
Similar to typeOf(), but returns the internal Drill names even if the value is NULL.

### Usage Notes

The data type functions are useful for data conversions. For example, if you know a column value is `Nullable Int`, you can assume that the data type is one that Drill derived. You can then merge the Drill-derived data type with the data type from another file that has actual values.

### Usage Examples

The follow examples show you how you can use the data type functions:

**Example 1**
This example shows the Drill internal type, nullable int, for a missing column:

       SELECT sqlTypeOf(a) AS a_type, modeOf(a) AS a_mode FROM `json/all-null.json`;

       |----------|-----------|
       |  a_type  |  a_mode   |
       |----------|-----------|
       | INTEGER  | NULLABLE  |
       |----------|-----------|

**Example 2**
This example shows arrays (repeated) types:

       SELECT sqlTypeOf(columns) as col_type, modeOf(columns) as col_mode
       FROM `csv/cust.csv`;

       |--------------------|-----------|
       |      col_type      | col_mode  |
       |--------------------|-----------|
       | CHARACTER VARYING  | ARRAY     |
       |--------------------|-----------|
       Example 3: This example shows non-null types:
       SELECT sqlTypeOf(`name`) AS name_type,
       modeOf(`name`) AS name_mode FROM `csvh/cust.csvh`;

       |--------------------|------------|
       |     name_type      | name_mode  |
       |--------------------|------------|
       | CHARACTER VARYING  | NOT NULL   |
       |--------------------|------------|
