You can run Drill queries from Postman, a Chrome browser extension and HTTP client for testing web services. To run Drill queries from Postman, install the Postman extension and then configure Postman to connect to a Drillbit and run queries.

Complete the following steps to install and configure Postman to run Drill queries:

1-To install the Postman Chrome browser extension, go to [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en) and then click **+ ADD TO CHROME**.
2-Click ![Postman Icon](https://i.imgur.com/a4pg98J.png) to open the application. You can go to [chrome://apps/](chrome://apps/) to find the Postman icon if you do not see it.
3-In a new tab on the Builder page, set the type to **POST**, and enter the request URL as  `http://<drillbit-hostname>:8047/query.json`.

6-In the body box, enter the request body in JSON format. For example, a test.csv file resides under the /tmp folder in the `dfs.tmp` schema. To test your configuration, you can enter the following query on the test.csv file:

       {
       "queryType": "SQL",
       "query": "select * from `dfs.tmp`.`test.csv`"
       }
